*functionally 100% finished, but with some small things to clean up still.

(Where's Wally outside of North America) A game where you need to search for characters like in the children's puzzle book game.

Built using React, and Google Firebase for back end.

If you can't find the 3 characters, try looking under Zapdos's wing, to the right of Gengar, and underneath Tentacruel!
